# NGSS Physics Energy Unit Plan

## Project Charter

This repository contains a comprehensive, well-structured, and openly-licensed sample unit plan for a 9th-grade physics topic focused on **Energy**. The unit plan serves as a high-quality template that local school districts can adapt and implement, demonstrating a model of state-level uniformity with local flexibility.

### Target NGSS Performance Expectations
- **HS-PS3-1:** Create a computational model to calculate the change in the energy of one component in a system when the change in energy of the other component(s) and energy flows in and out of the system are known.
- **HS-PS3-2:** Develop and use models to illustrate that energy at the macroscopic scale can be accounted for as a combination of energy associated with the motion of particles (objects) and energy associated with the relative positions of particles (objects).
- **HS-PS3-3:** Design, build, and refine a device that works within given constraints to convert one form of energy into another form of energy.

### Goals
1. Provide a ready-to-use unit plan that aligns with NGSS three-dimensional learning.
2. Model effective integration of Science and Engineering Practices (SEPs), Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs), and Crosscutting Concepts (CCCs).
3. Offer a template that districts can modify to fit local contexts while maintaining alignment to state standards.
4. Demonstrate collaborative curriculum development using modern tools (GitHub).

### Repository Structure
- `lessons/`: Detailed lesson plans for each session.
- `assessments/`: Formative and summative assessment materials.
- `resources/`: Additional materials (worksheets, presentations, etc.).
- `docs/`: Supporting documentation and alignment matrices.

### Development Process
This unit plan is developed through a collaborative workflow using GitHub Issues, Branches, Pull Requests, and Reviews—simulating a professional curriculum development team.
